# WordTracker


This is a simple experiment for a larger project to create a full stack mobile application to track the amont of words per day you speak. As the project develops, we will be adding some sentiment analysis and hopefully moving to a faster backend. Currently the program is built completely in python using the kivy library and PocketSphinx. This repository presents the minimum viable product of a social media app centered around the words that we use every day.
